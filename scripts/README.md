Download trial texts by offence category
-----------
Python scripts based on programming historian tutorial by Adam Crymble on [Downloading multiple records](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/downloading-multiple-records-using-query-strings)
 
* download_offence_category.py
* obo_offence_cat.py

Adam's tutorial is on downloading sets of trials as html files from keyword searches; I tweaked the code for use on offence categories/subcategories. Further tweakage (eg by punishment categories) would be a relatively simple process.

If you want to strip out the html tags from the downloaded files try the PH tutorials on [From HTML to List of Words](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/from-html-to-list-of-words-1)
